CONTRIBUTING

  1. Helium was conceived using the Eclipse IDE, version 3.0
     (http://www.eclipse.org/) and all contributing development thereof
     should be made with equivalent or later version.

  2. Helium is developed with J2SDK 1.4.2_x and all contributing
     development thereof should be made with equivalent version.

  3. All development is to be completed using the Test Driven
     Development (TDD) methodology and the JUnit Testing Framework. If
     you are new to TDD or JUnit, check out the following sites:
       - http://www.extremeprogramming.org/
       - http://www.junit.org/

     And mailing lists:
       - http://groups.yahoo.com/group/junit/
       - http://groups.yahoo.com/group/refactoring/

BUILDING

  Run Ant on build.xml in the Helium directory. The default target
  (all) will build helium-v<version>-<timestamp>.zip in the same
  directory. The <version> can be changed by editing the [version]
  property in the [build.properties] file before running the Ant
  script.

  > ant
    or
  > ant all

  This Zip file will contain the following:
    1. The runtime library [helium.jar]
    2. The source code [helium-src.jar]
    3. The JavaDoc's [helium-javadoc.jar]
    4. All documentation [docs/]

  To build just the runtime library, run Ant using the [dist] target.
  This will build helium.jar in the same directory, which is an
  executable JAR.
  
  > ant dist

  To build a distribution without debugging information in the Helium
  classes, modify [build.properties] and set the value of the [debug]
  property to [off]. Then, re-run the [dist] target.

  > build.properties: debug=off
  > ant dist

  The javadoc can be built using the same Ant build script, but by
  executing the "javadoc" target. The documentation will be found in
  [Helium/build/helium-javadoc.jar].

  > ant javadoc

  The Coverage report is built with a different Ant script,
  [coverage.xml]. The documentation will be found in
  [Helium/build/helium-coverage.jar]. Unpack the jar in some local
  directory to browse the report. Coverage is reported via EMMA
  (http://emma.sourceforge.net).

  > ant -f coverage.xml

INSTALLING and RUNNING

  After building Helium, copy [Helium/build/helium.jar] to any
  directory and run using a normal Java VM.

  > java -jar helium.jar <uri-to-article>
  
  See the Design document for examples of running Helium on the command
  line and generating Articles.

TESTING
