<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>The following assumes basic familiarity with use of <a
    href="source-repository.html">source repository</a> and command-line
build systems.</p>

<h2>Building with Maven</h2>

<p><a href="http://maven.apache.org">Maven</a> is a network-based
build management system. We assume the binary distribution has been
installed (version 2.2.1 or above, 3.0 or above for reporting) and that the executable <b>mvn</b> is
in the system path.</p>
<p>People new to Maven may find useful to download a <a
    href="http://maven.apache.org/apache-maven.pdf">PDF</a> version of
the website documentation. There is also extensive free documentation
available from the <a href="http://www.sonatype.com/book">Sonatype Maven Books</a>.</p>

<h3>Maven settings.xml</h3>

<p>To activate the use of the settings.xml provided:</p>

<pre class="brush: plain">
mvn -s settings.xml clean install 
</pre>

<span class="followup">The <b>settings.xml</b> defines the repositories for all the required dependencies that are not found in Maven Central.
Typically, you need to invoke the <b>-s settings.xml</b> only once to cache the dependencies.  Also, if you are running in a corporate environment, 
you may be using a Maven Repository Manager, such as Nexus, which may proxy the repositories behind a public open-source group.</span>

<h3>Maven build profiles</h3>

<p>One of Maven's most useful features are <a
    href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-profiles.html">profiles</a>.</p>

<p>JBehave's profiles are:</p>

<ul>
    <li>default: builds all releasable modules</li>
    <li>examples: runs examples</li>
    <li>gui: runs examples that require non-headless mode
    (separated as they do not run on <a
        href="continuous-integration.html">CI</a>)</li>
    <li>reporting: builds reports</li>
    <li>distribution: builds distributions, both "bin" and "src"</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that profiles are additive and the default profile is always active.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<pre class="brush: plain">
mvn clean install -Pexamples (build core and runs examples, excluding GUI-based ones)
mvn clean install -Pexamples,gui (build core and runs all examples, including GUI-based ones)
mvn clean install -Preporting,distribution (build with reporting and distribution)
</pre>

<p>Note that the Maven build phase <b>install</b> is used as it
automatically implies all other previous phases in the module <a
    href="http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html">build
cycle</a>, in particular the <b>test</b> or <b>integration-test</b> phases,
where appropriate.</p>

<h3>Performing a release</h3>

<p>Using Maven's release plugin makes the release process very easy:</p>

<pre class="brush: plain">
mvn release:prepare -Preporting,distribution 
mvn release:perform -Preporting,distribution
</pre>

<p>It is a two-step process as the first step (<b>release:prepare</b>)
creates a tag in source control replacing all snapshot versions with a
fixed version, while the second step (<b>release:perform</b>) builds the
release from the tag and performs the upload to the remote repository.</p>

<h2>Integration with IDEs</h2>

<p>Maven is supported in most modern IDEs - e.g. <a
    href="http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/features/ant_maven.html">Intellij
IDEA</a> or Eclipse (via the <a href="http://m2eclipse.sonatype.org">m2eclipse
plugin</a>). It builds the project classpath based on the dependencies
declared in the POMs.</p>
