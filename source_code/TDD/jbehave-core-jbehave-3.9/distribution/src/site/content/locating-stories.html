<h2>Locating Stories</h2>

<p>In JBehave, stories can be located locally, i.e. in class path, or externally, locatable via URLs.
    Depending on where the stories are located, an appropriate <a
            href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/io/StoryLoader.html">StoryLoader</a> needs to be defined:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/io/LoadFromClasspath.html">LoadFromClasspath</a> for
        stories located in classpath.
    </li>
        <li>
        <a href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/io/LoadFromURL.html">LoadFromURL</a> for
        stories located via URL.
    </li>
</ul>

<span>By default, JBehave expects stories to be written in plain text, but also supports other formats as long as these
can be converted to a textual which is then parsed by the  <a
            href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/parsers/StoryParser.html">StoryParser</a>.</span>

<p>More details and examples can be found in <a href="configuration.html">Configuration</a> page.
</p>

<h2>Stories in ODT Format</h2>

<p>JBehave supports <a
            href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument">OpenDocument Text</a> format via the <a href="http://odftoolkit.org/">ODF Toolkit</a>:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="javadoc/odf/org/jbehave/core/io/odf/LoadOdtFromClasspath.html">LoadOdtFromClasspath</a> for
        stories located in classpath.
    </li>
    <li>
        <a href="javadoc/odf/org/jbehave/core/io/odf/LoadOdtFromURL.html">LoadOdtFromURL</a> for
        stories located via URL.
    </li>
</ul>


<h2>Stories in Google Docs</h2>

<p>JBehave can locate stories stored as Google Docs:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <a href="javadoc/google/org/jbehave/core/io/google/LoadOdtFromGoogle.html">LoadOdtFromGoogle</a> for
        stories located in a configurable feed URI in Google Docs.  User needs to provide the authentication credentials.
    </li>
</ul>
