<h2>From 3.0 to 3.1</h2>

<p>The Story Maps view has been added to the Story Reports view. As
such, the default output directory has been renamed from <b>jbehave-reports</b>
to <b>jbehave</b>. The main index view in <b>target/jbehave/view/index.html</b>
now links to both the maps and reports views (<b>view/maps.html</b> and
<b>view/reports.html</b>, respectively). Currently, it assumes that both
views are generated and there is no check on whether these views exist
or not. An upcoming enhancement will determine which views have actually
been generated and enabled the links accordingly.</p>

<p>Operationally, users should change the target view directory of
the jbehave view resources to <b>target/jbehave/view</b>. Maven users
can use the new <b>unpack-view-resources</b> goal which will derive the
view directory from the configured Embedder.</p>

<p>It is also recommended to use the latest released version <b>3.1.1</b>
of the <b>jbehave-site-resources.zip</b>, which uses a SyntaxHighlighter BDD brush
to decorate all plain-text output.</p>

<h2>From 2.x to 3.0</h2>

<p>JBehave 3.x is an evolution of 2.x, based on the experience using
it in commercial projects. With the benefit of this experience, we feel
that the overall design stood well the wear and tear, but there were
areas which called for improvements that required to break backward
compatibility.</p>

<p>From the textual stories point of view, these are almost
completely backward compatible. The only exceptions being:</p>

<ul>
	<li><b>GivenScenarios</b> keyword has changed to <b>GivenStories</b>.
	Full backward compatibility can be nonetheless ensures by configuring
	the keywords bundle entry to <b>GivenScenarios</b> until the migration
	has been completed. See <a href="stories-in-your-language.html">stories
	in your language</a> on how to configure and override default keywords to
	suit your needs.</li>
	<li>Regex-based story parser now enforces that step keywords must
	be at the start of a new line. This allow keywords to be found in the
	step text and in the examples table. The convention of having keywords
	at start of line is already universally adopted and but may encounter
	the occasional failure due spurious spaces before the keywords.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the Java point of view, significant changes have occurred,
but only in the configuration of the running of the stories. The Steps
classes, which is where most users' efforts will have gone into can be
used without change in JBehave 3.</p>

<p>On the configuration side, the main changes are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Terminology has changed throughout to refer to <b>Story</b> in
	place of <b>Scenario</b> where this refers to the textual or Java
	representation reflecting the fact that scenarios in JBehave 2 were
	already stories in all but name. Terminology concerning report
	rendering has been changed to view generation.</li>
	<li>The Ant tasks and Maven goals have also been renamed to
	reflect the terminology change.</li>
	<li>To facilitate the migration due to the terminology changes in
	the textual scenarios/stories and in the Ant/Maven files, one can use
	the script provided in the <a
		href="http://git.codehaus.org/gitweb.cgi?p=jbehave-core.git;a=tree;f=examples/migrating-from-2.x">migrating-from-2.x
	example</a>.</li>
	<li>The root package has changed from <b>org.jbehave.scenario</b>
	to <b>org.jbehave.core</b> to avoid classpath clashes.</li>
	<li><b>JUnitStory</b> does not extend JUnit's TestCase any more.
	To ensure the class is recognised as a JUnit test, you must make the
	source code of jbehave-core available to your IDE. Alternatively, check
	the <a href="faq.html">FAQ</a> for other workarounds.</li>
	<li>The concerns of running stories and view generation has been
	centralised in an embeddable component - <b>Embedder</b> - around which
	there are thin wrappers for running in multiple environments, e.g.
	JUnit, Ant/Maven, Spring etc. Using the Embedder, the user can choose
	to run multiple textual story using a single Java entry point. The
	embedder behaviours can be controlled via <b>EmbedderControls</b>.</li>
	<li>JUnitStory is now a JUnit-specific extension of <b>ConfigurableEmbedder</b>
	and allows the overriding of the default MostUsefulConfiguration only
	via the <b>useConfiguration</b> method, and the specification of <b>Steps</b>
	only via the <b>addSteps</b> method. Equivalently, the user can
	override the methods <b>configuration()</b> and <b>candidateSteps()</b>.</li>
	<li>Configuration has been consolidated into a single builder and
	moved to <b>org.jbehave.core.configuration</b> package. Configuration
	and CandidateSteps are now fully specifiable via <a
		href="configuration.html">annotations</a>, with or without <a
		href="dependency-injection.html">dependency injection</a>.</li>
	<li>The textual story lookup paradigm has shifted from an <b>Embeddable</b>
	class to a story path, which can be resolved from the class via the <b>StoryPathResolver</b>,
	and its implementations <b>UnderscoredCamelCaseResolver</b> and <b>CasePreservingResolver</b>.
	As such, the <b>StoryLoader</b> implementations only define the model
	story from a story path. The <b>FilePrintStreamFactory</b>
	correspondingly now handles only story paths.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Next?</h2>

<span class="followup">JBehave development has been
example-driven and the examples illustrate all the features, migrated
from 2.x or new in 3.x. Be sure check out the <a
	href="running-examples.html">running examples</a>, as it's the quickest
and most instructive way to get up to speed with the changes outlined
above.</span>
