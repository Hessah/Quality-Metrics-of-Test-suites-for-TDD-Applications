<h2>Story Syntax</h2>

<span class="followup">JBehave supports multiple story syntaxes.</span>

<h2>JBehave Syntax</h2>

<p>JBehave's syntax is supported
by the <a
    href="javadoc/core/org/jbehave/core/parsers//RegexStoryParser.html">RegexStoryParser</a>:</p>

<pre class="brush: bdd">
A story is a collection of scenarios

Narrative:
In order to communicate effectively to the business some functionality
As a development team
I want to use Behaviour-Driven Development

Lifecycle: 
Before:
Given a step that is executed before each scenario 
After:
Given a step that is executed after each scenario 
    
Scenario:  A scenario is a collection of executable steps of different type

Given step represents a precondition to an event
When step represents the occurrence of the event
Then step represents the outcome of the event

Scenario:  Another scenario exploring different combination of events

Given a [precondition]
When a negative event occurs
Then a the outcome should [be-captured]    

Examples: 
|precondition|be-captured|
|abc|be captured    |
|xyz|not be captured|

</pre>

<h2>Gherkin Syntax</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/cucumber/cucumber/wiki/Gherkin">Gherkin</a> syntax is supported
by the <a
    href="javadoc/gherkin/org/jbehave/core/parsers/gherkin/GherkinStoryParser.html">GherkinStoryParser</a>:</p>

<pre class="brush: bdd">
Feature: A story is a collection of scenarios

Narrative:
In order to communicate effectively to the business some functionality
As a development team
I want to use Behaviour-Driven Development
    
Background: 

Given a step that is executed before each scenario 

Scenario:  A scenario is a collection of executable steps of different type

Given step represents a precondition to an event
When step represents the occurrence of the event
Then step represents the outcome of the event

Scenario Outline:  Another scenario exploring different combination of events

Given a [precondition]
When a negative event occurs
Then a the outcome should [be-captured]    

Examples: 
|precondition|be-captured|
|abc|be captured    |
|xyz|not be captured|
</pre>

<p>The Gherkin syntax is supported via <a href="story-transformers.html">story transformers</a>, that use
the Gherkin parser to transform the syntax to JBehave's.</p>

<span class="followup">Note that Gherkin's Background element corresponds to the JBehave Lifecycle Before element. 
JBehave also supports a Lifecycle After element which is not currently available in Gherkin.</span>
