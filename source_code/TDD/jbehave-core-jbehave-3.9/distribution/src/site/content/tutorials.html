<h2>Tutorials</h2>

<p>JBehave provides tutorials as examples of black-box integration-testing.   Tutorials live in a  
 <a href="https://github.com/jbehave/jbehave-tutorial">jbehave-tutorial</a> repo and in general show all components of JBehave in action, 
 including the JBehave Web components that build on JBehave Core to provide tools to test web application.
</p>

<h2>Etsy.com</h2>

<p>The Etsy tutorials use <a href="http://etsy.com">Etsy.com</a> as a live web application to test.  As such, it requires a live network connection to run.
The tutorial use the JBehave Selenium module to drive the web interaction via the WebDriver API.
</p>

<p>There are two modules for running stories that verify behaviour found in Etsy.com:</p>
<ul>
<li>etsy-stories-groovy-pico: the steps are written in Groovy and the steps classes are composed using Pico.</li>
<li>etsy-stories-java-spring: the steps are written in Java and the steps classes are composed using Spring</li>
</ul>
