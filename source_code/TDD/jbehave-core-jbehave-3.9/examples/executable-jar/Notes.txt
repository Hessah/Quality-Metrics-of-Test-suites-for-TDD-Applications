A simple example project showing how to put jbehave, your code and the
stories inside a executable/runnable jar.

The package target creates a jar file containing all classes from
jbehave and its dependencies that can be run with

jar -jar jbehave-executable-jar-example-<VERSION>-jar-with-dependencies.jar,
this way the tests do not have any dependencies except java itself.

Reading the list of story files from the jar file is supported starting
with jbehave 3.7.5. 

When creating the jar file with Maven, the file layout is correct, when
creating the jar file with Eclipse (Runnable JAR file), finding the
stories will work when selecting "Extract required libraries into generated
JAR", when selecting "Package required libraries into generated JAR", the
story files will not be found since searching inside a jar that is
accessible via resource manager is not implemented yet.
