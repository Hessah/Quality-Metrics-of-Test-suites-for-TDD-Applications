Narrative:
In order to communicate better
As a story writer
I want to be able to use ODT format

Scenario: a plain scenario
Given a step
When a step has failed
Then the scenario is visualized as failed

Scenario: a scenario with a given story

GivenStories: stories/a_successful_story.odt

Given a step
And the step is successful
Then the scenario is visualized as succeeded

Scenario: a scenario with examples

Given a <step>
When the <step> is executed
Then the result is <result>

Examples:
|step|result|
|one|1|
|two|2|
