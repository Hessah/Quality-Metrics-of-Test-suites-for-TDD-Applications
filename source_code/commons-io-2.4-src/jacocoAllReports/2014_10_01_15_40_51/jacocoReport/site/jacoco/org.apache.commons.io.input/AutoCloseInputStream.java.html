/**
 * Proxy stream that closes and discards the underlying stream as soon as the
 * end of input has been reached or when the stream is explicitly closed.
 * Not even a reference to the underlying stream is kept after it has been
 * closed, so any allocated in-memory buffers can be freed even if the
 * client application still keeps a reference to the proxy stream.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This class is typically used to release any resources related to an open
 * stream as soon as possible even if the client application (by not explicitly
 * closing the stream when no longer needed) or the underlying stream (by not
 * releasing resources once the last byte has been read) do not do that.
