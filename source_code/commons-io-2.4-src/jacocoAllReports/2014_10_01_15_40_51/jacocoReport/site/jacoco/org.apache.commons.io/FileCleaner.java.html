/**
 * Keeps track of files awaiting deletion, and deletes them when an associated
 * marker object is reclaimed by the garbage collector.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This utility creates a background thread to handle file deletion.
 * Each file to be deleted is registered with a handler object.
 * When the handler object is garbage collected, the file is deleted.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * In an environment with multiple class loaders (a servlet container, for
 * example), you should consider stopping the background thread if it is no
 * longer needed. This is done by invoking the method
 * {@link #exitWhenFinished}, typically in
 * {@link javax.servlet.ServletContextListener#contextDestroyed} or similar.

     * container is still running, then the file cleaner thread will still exist,
