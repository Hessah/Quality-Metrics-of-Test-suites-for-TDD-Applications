/**
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This class provides a generic implementation of the lazy initialization
 * pattern.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Sometimes an application has to deal with an object only under certain
 * circumstances, e.g. when the user selects a specific menu item or if a
 * special event is received. If the creation of the object is costly or the
 * consumption of memory or other system resources is significant, it may make
 * sense to defer the creation of this object until it is really needed. This is
 * a use case for the lazy initialization pattern.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This abstract base class provides an implementation of the double-check idiom
 * for an instance field as discussed in Joshua Bloch's &quot;Effective Java&quot;, 2nd
 * edition, item 71. The class already implements all necessary synchronization.
 * A concrete subclass has to implement the {@code initialize()} method, which
 * actually creates the wrapped data object.
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * As an usage example consider that we have a class {@code ComplexObject} whose
 * instantiation is a complex operation. In order to apply lazy initialization
 * to this class, a subclass of {@code LazyInitializer} has to be created:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * public class ComplexObjectInitializer extends LazyInitializer&amp;lt;ComplexObject&amp;gt; {
 *     &amp;#064;Override
 *     protected ComplexObject initialize() {
 *         return new ComplexObject();
 *     }
 * }
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * Access to the data object is provided through the {@code get()} method. So,
 * code that wants to obtain the {@code ComplexObject} instance would simply
 * look like this:
 *
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * // Create an instance of the lazy initializer
 * ComplexObjectInitializer initializer = new ComplexObjectInitializer();
 * ...
 * // When the object is actually needed:
 * ComplexObject cobj = initializer.get();
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 *
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * If multiple threads call the {@code get()} method when the object has not yet
 * been created, they are blocked until initialization completes. The algorithm
 * guarantees that only a single instance of the wrapped object class is
 * created, which is passed to all callers. Once initialized, calls to the
 * {@code get()} method are pretty fast because no synchronization is needed
 * (only an access to a &lt;b&gt;volatile&lt;/b&gt; member field).
 * &lt;/p&gt;
 *

 * @param &lt;T&gt; the type of the object managed by this initializer class
