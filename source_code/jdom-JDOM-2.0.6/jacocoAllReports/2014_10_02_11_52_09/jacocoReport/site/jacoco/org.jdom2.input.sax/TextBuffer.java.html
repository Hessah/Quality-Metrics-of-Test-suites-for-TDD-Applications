/**
 * A non-public utility class similar to StringBuilder but optimized for XML
 * parsing where the common case is that you get only one chunk of characters
 * per text section. TextBuffer stores the first chunk of characters in a
 * String, which can just be returned directly if no second chunk is received.
 * Subsequent chunks are stored in a supplemental char array (like StringBuilder
 * uses). In this case, the returned text will be the first String chunk,
 * concatenated with the subsequent chunks stored in the char array. This
 * provides optimal performance in the common case, while still providing very
 * good performance in the uncommon case. Furthermore, avoiding StringBuilder
 * means that no extra unused char array space will be kept around after parsing
 * is through.
