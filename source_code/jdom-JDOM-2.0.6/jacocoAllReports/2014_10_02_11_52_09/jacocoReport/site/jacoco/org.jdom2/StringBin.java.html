/**
 * This is a mechanism for storing and reusing unique instances of Strings.
 * The idea is that in XML the tag names, attribute names, and other String
 * content is often repeated a lot. Each repeat is typically done as a new
 * String instance. This class makes it possible to substantially reduce memory
 * usage by reusing String instances instead of keeping the new ones.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This class is not the same as String.intern() because String.intern() uses
 * the PermGen memory space (very limited in size), whereas this uses the heap.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The primary goal of this class is to be as memory efficient as possible. This
 * has the interesting side effect of reducing the amount of time spent in
 * garbage-collection cycles. While this does increase the amount of time to
 * process a String, it means that subsequent String values can be 'recycled'
 * fast, and, ideally, never need to leave the 'eden space' in the memory model
 * which in turn means that the duplicate strings do not even hit the GC
 * overhead. It is easy to measure that this process takes longer than simply
 * keeping the duplicate String values, but it is much harder to measure the
 * decreased cost of GC. It would be somewhat fair to say that the memory
 * benefit is substantial, and the cost of allocation is offset by the savings
 * in garbage collection. This trade-off is dependent on the amount of duplicate
 * data you have. In XML where there are lots of repeating patterns of element
 * and attribute names this can add up pretty fast.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * This class is not thread-safe.

		 *  we use a special masking routine here. This is important.
		 *  we always do a 16-bit shift, XOR it with the unshifted value, and
		 *  then apply the mask.
		 *  The reason is relatively simple: it makes rehashing much faster
		 *  because you never need to shift values in the rehash, they are always
		 *  just appended.
		 *  Further, there is no real need to get a true random distribution in
		 *  the buckets... it's not important. The String.hashCode() is a good
		 *  enough hash function so we do not lose much by doing it this way.
		 *  
		 *  In detail:
		 *  Normally for a bucketing/hashing system we will try to use as many
		 *  bits as possible to create the bucket hash for the value. In this
		 *  case though, we XOR the high 16 bits with the low 16 bits (and keep
		 *  the high 16 bits unchanged. Lets call this the 'interim result'.
		 *  We then apply our bit mask to that interim result to get the bucket
		 *  id. The important thing here is that the interim result is the same
		 *  no matter how many buckets there are.
		 *  
		 *  If we need to rehash the buckets, the mask will include more bits,
		 *  and that guarantees that the values in any one 'original' bucket
		 *  will be divided in to different buckets, and never merged with
		 *  values from a different original bucket.
		 *  
		 *  Thus, in a rehash, both because of the way we calculate the bucketid
		 *  and also because the values in a bucket are stored in increasing
		 *  hash value order, we never need to insert a value in to the middle
		 *  of the rehashed bucket, we can always add to the end.
