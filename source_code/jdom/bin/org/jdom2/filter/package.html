	Classes to both filter and generically type-cast nodes of a document
	based on type, name, value, or other aspects, and to boolean
	AND/OR/NEGATE these rules. Filters can be used in methods like
	getContent(Filter) and getDescendants(Filter). Filters are also used
	extensively in the XPath API. The <code>Filters</code> class provides access
	to a large number of useful filters, and also a sampling of generally useful
	filters is provided here. Additional filters can be user defined, and that
	is made easier by extending thr AbstractFilter class.
