  ElementScanner is a SAX filter that uses XPath-like expressions to
  select  element nodes to build and notifies listeners when these
  elements becomes available during the SAX parse.
  <p>
  ElementScanner does not aim at providing a faster parsing of XML
  documents.  Its primary focus is to allow the application to
  control the parse and to consume the XML data while they are
  being parsed.  ElementScanner can be viewed as a high-level SAX
  parser that fires events conveying JDOM
  {@link org.jdom.Element elements} rather that XML tags and
  character data.</p>
  <p>
  ElementScanner only notifies of the parsing of element nodes and
  does not support reporting the parsing of DOCTYPE data, processing
  instructions or comments except for those present within the
  selected elements.  Application needing such data shall register
  a specific {@link org.xml.sax.ContentHandler} of this filter to
  receive them in the form of raw SAX events.</p>
