Classes to build JDOM documents from various sources.
<p>
The most commonly used builder is SAXBuilder which constructs a JDOM document
using a SAX parser and can pull content from files, streams, sockets, readers,
and so on.  It can use any underlying SAX parser to handle the parsing chores.
<p>
DOMBuilder lets you build JDOM content from existing <code>org.w3c.dom.*</code>
instances.
<p>
The StAXStreamBuilder and StAXEventBuilder classes allow you to build JDOM
content from StAX-based XMLStreamReader and XMLEventReader instances.
