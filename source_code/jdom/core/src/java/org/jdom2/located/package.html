Extended JDOM Content Classes that contain location coordinates. The coordinates
are accessible using the <code>Located</code> interface which has getters and
setters for the line and column details.
<p>
In addition, there is the <code>LocatedJDOMFactory</code> which can be used to
create the <code>Located</code>-aware Content. The 
<code>LocatedJDOMFactory</code> can be used by a <code>SAXBuilder</code> to
preserve the location data on the Content.
