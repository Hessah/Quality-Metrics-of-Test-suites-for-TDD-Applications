	Support for XPath from within JDOM. XPath provides a common interface
	with a pluggable back-end. The default back end is Jaxen.
	<p>The JDOM 1.x API uses the XPath class as the entire API
		interface. This has been deprecated, and replaced with XPathFactory,
		XPathCompiled, and XPathBuilder.

		The XPathHelper class provides static methods to create XPath queries
		that identify specific JDOM nodes.
