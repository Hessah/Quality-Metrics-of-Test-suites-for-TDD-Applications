 * This {@link XMLReaderJDOMFactory} class returns XMLReaders configured to

 * schema or some other schema supported by SAX (e.g. RelaxNG). The SAX Parser
 * is obtained through the JAXP process.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * If you want to validate an XML document against the XSD references embedded
 * in the XML itself (xsdSchemaLocation) then you do not want to use this class
 * but rather use an alternate means like
 * {@link XMLReaders#XSDVALIDATING}.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * See the {@link org.jdom2.input.sax package documentation} for the best
 * alternatives.
