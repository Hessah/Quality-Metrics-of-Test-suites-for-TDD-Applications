/**
 * A complete (but still abstract) implementation of a class that produces
 * XMLStreamReaders based on the class AbstractXMLStreamReader. Users who need
 * to make changes to the output format that are not possible with just the
 * Format class, may need to extend this class to create instances of their own
 * XMLStreamReader. Their own implementation could in turn extend the AbstractXMLReader
 * class which contains the bulk of the StAX Logic.
