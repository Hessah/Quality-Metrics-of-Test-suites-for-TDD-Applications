/**
 * An enumeration of common separators that are used for JDOM output.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * These enumerated values can be used as input to the
 * {@link Format#setLineSeparator(LineSeparator)} method. Additionally, the
 * names of these constants can be also be used in the System Property
 * {@link JDOMConstants#JDOM2_PROPERTY_LINE_SEPARATOR} which is used to
 * define the default Line Separator sequence for JDOM output. See
 * {@link #DEFAULT} Javadoc.
 * 
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * JDOM has historically used the CR/NL sequence '\r\n' as a line-terminator.
 * This sequence has the advantage that the output is easily opened in the 
 * 'Notepad' editor on Windows. Other editors on other platforms are typically
 * smart enough to automatically adjust to whatever termination sequence is
 * used in the document. The XML specification requires that the CR/NL sequence
 * should be 'normalized' to a single newline '\n' when the document is parsed
 * (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.w3.org/TR/xml11/#sec-line-ends&quot;&gt;XML 1.1 End-Of-Line
 * Handling&lt;/a&gt;). As a result there is no XML issue with the JDOM default CR/NL
 * end-of-line sequence.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * It should be noted that because JDOM internally stores just a '\n' as a line
 * separator that any other output separator requires additional processing to
 * output. There is a distinct performance benefit for using the UNIX, or NL
 * LineSeparator for output.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * JDOM has always allowed the line-terminating sequence to be customised (or
 * even disabled) for each {@link XMLOutputter} operation by using this Format
 * class.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * JDOM2 introduces two new features in relation to the end-of-line sequence.
 * Firstly, it introduces this new {@link LineSeparator} enumeration which
 * formalises the common line separators that can be used. In addition to the
 * simple String-based {@link Format#setLineSeparator(String)} method you can
 * now also call {@link Format#setLineSeparator(LineSeparator)} with one of the
 * common enumerations.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * The second new JDOM2 feature is the ability to set a global default
 * end-of-line sequence. JDOM 1.x forced the default sequence to be the CRLF
 * sequence, but JDOM2 allows you to set the system property
 * {@link JDOMConstants#JDOM2_PROPERTY_LINE_SEPARATOR} which will be used as the
 * default sequence for Format. You can set the property to be the name of one
 * of these LineSeparator enumerations too. For example, the following will
 * cause all default Format instances to use the System-dependent end-of-line
 * sequence instead of always CRLF:
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * &lt;pre&gt;
 * java -Dorg.jdom2.output.LineSeparator=SYSTEM ...
 * &lt;/pre&gt;
 * 
 * @since JDOM2
