/**
 * A collection of constants that may be useful to JDOM users.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * JDOM attempts to make knowing these 'magic' constants unnecessary, but it is
 * not always possible. In an attempt to make it easier though, common constants
 * are defined here. This is not a comprehensive list of all the constants that
 * may be useful when processing XML, but it should cover most of those occasions
 * where JDOM does not automatically do the 'right thing'.
 * &lt;p&gt;
 * Many of these constants are already referenced inside the JDOM code.
