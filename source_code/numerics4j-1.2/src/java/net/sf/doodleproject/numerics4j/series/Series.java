/**
 * <p>
 * This class provides the means to evaluate infinite series (1).  To create a
 * series, authors subclass this class and provided a concrete term method.  Of
 * note, when evaluating a series, the term indicies are the nonnegative
 * integers.  That is to say, the first term is at index zero and each
 * subsequent term increases the index by one.  It is the responsibility of the
 * author to shift term indices as needed if a series does not start at zero or
 * if the indices are not unit increments. 
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * For example, this is the series for the exponential function
 * defined by (2):
 * <pre>Series exponential = new Series() {
 *     public double getTerm(int n, double x) {
 *         return Math.pow(x, n) / factorial(n);
 *     }
 * 
 *     private double factorial(int n) {
 *         double p = 1.0;
 *         while(n > 1.0) {
 *             p *= n--;
 *         }
 *         return p;
 *     }
 * }</pre>
