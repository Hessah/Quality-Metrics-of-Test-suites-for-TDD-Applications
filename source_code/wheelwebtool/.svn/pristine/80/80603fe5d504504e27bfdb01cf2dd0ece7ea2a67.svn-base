Roadmap

 * 0.8 - will be the first public release. During the 0.8 releases the design will still be partly open as will the APIs. Final plan for 1.0 features.

 * 0.9 - The design for 1.0 should be mostly closed as will be the main APIs. 0.9 series will implement 1.0 functionality and tests.

 * 1.0 - Should be production-quality release. Should contain a users guide.

 * 1.1 - Will be an AJAX-release

* Future ideas

 * A generation-tool that would generate Wheel ui-code from existing xhtml.

 * Sibling project that would produce larger reusable components for RAD-development needs.
