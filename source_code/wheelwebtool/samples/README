in the root directory.

Running the samples application:
--------------------------------

mvn jetty:run

Open your browser and use the address: http://localhost:8080/samples/app


Modifying the samples application:
----------------------------------

When you make any changes to the source classfiles or create new ones, leave the jetty console open, open another console,
go to the samples directory and use this command:

mvn compile

Then refresh your browser to see the changes.
